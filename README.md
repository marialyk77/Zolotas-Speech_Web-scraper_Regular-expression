## Hello!!!!!!!!!!! 

  ## Background
   
  Zolotas delivered two speeches in English, using predominantly Greek words to underscore the richness of the Greek language and its influence on other languages, particularly English.

  ## Project Objectives

   - This project focuses on scraping a speech delivered by Zolotas on October 2, 1959. 

   - The speech was retrieved from: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon_Zolotas.

   - An iterative process was employed to extract the specific paragraph that i was interested from the scraped text. 

   - The text was cleaned of punctuation using Regular Expression and formatted to lowercase to facilitate counting the occurrence of each word. 

   - After separating each word into its own value using the re.split() function, I stored the resulting list of words in a DataFrame. 
   
   - Subsequently, I exported the DataFrame to a CSV file for easy access.


ðŸ’– I would like to extend my gratitude to Alex Freberg and his course, 'Python Programming for Beginners,' where I learned the valuable skills and techniques for scraping data from online sources. Without this foundational knowledge, this project would not have been possible. Thank you, Alex, for your guidance and support in my journey to mastering Python programming.
