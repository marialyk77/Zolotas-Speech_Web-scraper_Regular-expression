## Hello!!!!!!!!!!! 

  ## Background
   
  Zolotas delivered two speeches in English, using predominantly Greek words to underscore the richness of the Greek language and its influence on other languages, particularly English.

  ## Project Objectives

   - This project focuses on scraping a speech delivered by Zolotas on October 2, 1959. 

   - The speech was retrieved from: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon_Zolotas.

   - An iterative process was employed to extract the specific paragraph that i was interested from the scraped text. 

   - The text was cleaned of punctuation using Regular Expression and formatted to lowercase to facilitate counting the occurrence of each word. 

   - After separating each word into its own value using the re.split() function, I stored the resulting list of words in a DataFrame. 
   
   - Subsequently, I exported the DataFrame to a CSV file for easy access.
